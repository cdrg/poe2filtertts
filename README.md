Text-To-Speech sound files for Path of Exile 2 filters

Planned for the future:
- More choices of voices
- Scripts and other help for creating sets of files with voices
- Documentation of directory/file layout

### Note: Custom sound files and filters that use them only work on PC, not console.

### Link to filters: https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/cdrpoe-1004/item-filters

## Installation instructions
- Choose and download a voice .zip in Releases, such as "AWSPolly-Matthew.zip"
- Extract the "sounds" folder in the .zip to your Path of Exile 2 filter folder
  - Leave the "sounds" folder intact.
  - There's a button in Options > Game to open the filter folder.
