If you want to see particular voice, suggest it! Freely redistributable voices only.

### Note: Custom sound files and filters that use them only work on PC, not console.

- Extract the "sounds" folder in the .zip to your Path of Exile 2 filter folder
  - Leave the "sounds" folder intact.
  - There's a button in Options > Game to open the filter folder.
